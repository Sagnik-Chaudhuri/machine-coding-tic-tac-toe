Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs
and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take
turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds
in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is
a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
Design and develop a system which can play this game against a human. The system
should be able to:
1. Start as a console application
2. Take inputs from the console
3. Conduct a toss when the game starts and proceed based on the winner of the
   toss.
4. Should show the winner if somebody wins the game.
